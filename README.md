## How I Work
### Developer autonomy and ownership
* I like staying out of the engineers’ way and letting them use their best judgement on things. I think developers are domain experts and should have ownership over the way that we execute engineering projects.
* Sometimes I’ll drop into a Product meeting with your team and ask questions or for help in solving a problem like timelines, requirements, etc. Sometimes I’ll ask questions meant to challenge assumptions or encourage some debate, but not to tell you how to write something.
* My main priority is making sure you're working on things that are meaningful to both you and the company, and that you feel empowered to do that to the best of your abilities.


### Purposeful, productive meetings.
* I tend to get kind of impatient if I feel like a conversation isn’t going anywhere.
* Guidelines for productive meetings:
    * Have solution oriented discussions.
    * Notes and agendas are encouraged, especially for meetings with large groups.
    * Be inclusive - make room for everyone to contribute. Try to get to your point quickly. Take pauses that allow others to jump in. Ask people questions. Make sure people are engaging with you. If they’re not engaging with the topic, or you don’t feel the need to ask them questions, consider that they may not need to be in the meeting at all.


### Ongoing Improvements
* Increasing your visibility into my day and work. (Oct 2018)
    * Get better at keeping my Slack status up to date
    * Attend standups periodically and talk to you about what I’m working on.
* Get to the point faster when delivering disappointing news. Rip off the bandaid. (Dec 2018)
* Bridge communication between upper management and engineers. (Nov 2018)
* Encourage brevity during meetings by having a heavier hand in meeting facilitation - especially meetings between engineers and designers. (Oct 2018)

## Misc. About Me
### Work Stuff:
* I’m a former developer, and most of my experience is on the front end. I still do side projects sometimes. My Codepen is mostly CSS animation experiments and debugging some random JS, feel free to find me on there @careecodes.
* I have always wanted to work remotely. Creative Market was on my list of “dream companies” for several years before I was hired.
* I like to write and have a blog: https://blog.caree.codes/

### Other Stuff:
* I’m very introverted and sometimes spend too much time in my head.
* I like to draw! I’m really interested in photorealism and life drawing. 
* I also run (slowly) and practice yoga (badly).
* I’m married to a guy named Justin and we have a dog named Daisy.
* If you’re into personality tests, here are my results:
    * Meyers-Briggs: INTJ
    * StrengthFinder: Restorative, Futuristic, Competition, Arranger, Learner
    * Hogwarts House: Slytherin
    * Take these too, and we can compare notes in a 1:1 sometime! :)
