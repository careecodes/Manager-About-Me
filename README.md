## How I Work
### Developer autonomy and ownership
* Developers are domain experts and should have ownership over the way that we execute engineering projects.
* I'm here to guide projects and provide context and information about other departments, and about upper management. Sometimes I’ll drop into a Product meeting with your team and ask questions or for help in solving a problem like timelines, requirements, etc.
* My main priority is making sure you're working on things that are meaningful to both you and the company, and that you feel empowered to do that to the best of your abilities. Let me know if you're blocked!


### Purposeful, productive meetings.
* Guidelines for productive meetings:
    * Have solution-oriented discussions. 
      * If you've circled around the problem for a long time and haven't gotten anywhere, consider that you might not have all of the information or people to have this conversation.
    * Be inclusive - make room for everyone to contribute. 
      * Try to get to your point quickly. 
      * Take pauses that allow others to jump in. Ask people questions. 
      * If people aren't not engaging with the topic, or you don’t feel the need to ask them questions, consider that they may not need to be in this meeting.
   * Know your audience: try not to get too technical if your audience is mostly non-technical people. Try to schedule in-depth technical conversations that come up for another time.
   * Notes and agendas are encouraged for meetings with large groups.


### Ongoing Improvements - This section changes, and is where I need your input.
* Increasing your visibility into my day and work. (Oct 2018)
    * Get better at keeping my Slack status up to date
    * Attend standups periodically and talk to you about what I’m working on.
* Get to the point faster when delivering disappointing news. Rip off the bandaid. (Dec 2018)
* Bridge communication between upper management and engineers. (Nov 2018)
* Encourage brevity during meetings by having a heavier hand in meeting facilitation - especially meetings between engineers and designers. (Oct 2018)
* **[Your feedback here]**


## Misc. About Me
### Work Stuff:
* I’m a former developer, and most of my experience is on the front end. I still do side projects sometimes. My Codepen is mostly CSS animation experiments and debugging some random JS, feel free to find me on there @careecodes.
* I have always wanted to work remotely. Creative Market was on my list of “dream companies” for several years before I was hired.
* I like to write and have a blog: https://blog.caree.codes/

### Other Stuff:
* I’m very introverted. 
* I like to draw! I’m really interested in photorealism and life drawing. 
* I also run (slowly) and practice yoga (badly).
* I’m married to a guy named Justin and we have a dog named Daisy.
* If you’re into personality tests, here are my results:
    * Meyers-Briggs: INTJ
    * StrengthFinder: Restorative, Futuristic, Competition, Arranger, Learner
    * Hogwarts House: Slytherin
    * Take these too, and we can compare notes in a 1:1 sometime! :)
