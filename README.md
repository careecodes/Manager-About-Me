## How I Work
### Developer autonomy and ownership
* Developers are domain experts and should have ownership over the way that we execute engineering projects.
* I'm here to guide projects and provide context and information about other departments, and about upper management. Sometimes I’ll drop into a Product meeting with your team and ask questions or for help in solving a problem like timelines, requirements, etc.
* My main priority is making sure you're working on things that are meaningful to both you and the company, and that you feel empowered to do that to the best of your abilities. Let me know if you're blocked!

### Meetings
* Meetings on my calendar are always visible to you, and you never need my permission through Slack to send me a meeting invite. If the time slot is open, grab it! 
* If you have an urgent topic, shoot me a Slack message. I can almost always move around my day to meet with you. Don't wait for our next 1:1. _I'd much rather move my calendar around and talk to you sooner than learn about something important later._

### 1:1s
* Our 1:1s will vary depending on what's going on. But if we're doing things right, we are regularly covering these topics: Your career growth, feedback (yours and mine), and current projects and needs (yours and mine).
* As a baseline, I like to meet with you every two weeks. We can increase frequency as needed or desired. Meeting with you  more often does not mean that you are doing something poorly.
* I have agenda documents for my 1:1s that I share with you. I will put topics in the doc ahead of time so that you know what I want to cover. I also expect you to add things to this doc as needed.
* 1:1s do not have to be structured or formal. But I do ask that you come prepared and undistracted. I may ask you to close Slack during our meeting, or give you a little "homework" to complete or think about before our next talk. I will always give you my undivided attention in our 1:1s.

### Feedback
* Feedback is a two-way conversation - but I understand that giving feedback to your manager can be uncomfortable and may require trust-building and time.
* I aim to give you feedback that is A.S.K. - Actionable, Specific, Kind. You should always walk away from feedback knowing what you can _specifically do_ to improve, or what you _specifically did_ that I am giving you feedback on.
* Feedback does not mean you are doing poorly. Everyone gets feedback from me, because everyone on my team should always be growing and have goals. If I think you are underperforming, I will make this known. You should always know where you stand with me regarding your performance.
* Ambiguous feedback sucks. If you feel confused by any feedback you recieve from me, it's okay to ask me to clarify.


## Other Info
* As a rule, I don't add my direct reports on social media platforms (the exception being Twitter). This is because I don't want to display favoritism or make someone feel excluded. (In your career, have you ever felt like leadership had an "inner circle"? I have been there before, and it sucks.) However, after you or I have moved on from the company, I would love to connect with you.
* It's very important to me that everyone on my team is comfortable and feels included and respected. I try my best to create an environment where that is true, but if that is not your experience, please let me know - even if the reason you feel that way is because of something that I said or did. _Especially_ if it's because of something I said or did.

## Misc. About Me
### Career Stuff:
* I’m a former developer, and most of my experience is on the front end. I still do side projects sometimes. My Codepen is mostly CSS animation experiments and debugging some random JS, but feel free to find me on there @careecodes.
* In addition to front end development, I have always been passionate about remote working.
* I like to write and have a blog: https://blog.caree.codes/

### Non-Career Stuff:
* I like to draw. I used to be really interested in photorealism and life drawing through the mediums of graphit and charcoal. But lately I've taken up watercolor and gouache. It's challenging and I'm not very good at it yet, but it's a lot of fun.
* I also run and practice yoga. In 2018 I ran my first 5k and hope to work my way up to a half marathon in 2020. 
* I'm married and have a <1 yr son. We also have a dog named Daisy. You'll probably see a lot of photos on Slack!
